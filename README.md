A Decentralized Exchange that helps to exchange ERC-20 tokens without a central authority. 

Centralized exchanges have a lot of control over tokens and can list/delist at will. 
There is a security risk that funds could be lost if there is a breach (single poin of failure).


However, DEXes simply need a liquidity pair to operate. Participants can contribute to the liquidity pair and get rewards from the fees.

I created a few tokens with my naem and this can be bought with Goerli testnet WETH.
